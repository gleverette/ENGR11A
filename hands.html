            Creating a "Functional" 3D Print
        </h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-4" style="text-align: justify; padding-left:60px" >
                <p> 
                    After learning how to import a model, slice it in its respective software, and properly callibrate a 3D printer, it was time to come up with some new designs 
                    that would test the functional limits of completed 3D print. I initally aimed to create a jar opener for people suffering from arthritis in their hands. Taking 
                    inspiration from my mom, one thing I always hear her comment about is opening jars. It causes too much stress on her finger joints, mainly when she is applying pressure 
                    to turn the lid. With my design, I hoped to achieve a high pressure force on the jar lid with minimal pressure required. The solution: a winged corkscrew.<br><br>

                    A winged corkscrew uses a lever and gears to drive a worm down into the cork. As the worm goes down, the levers lift up (henced the "winged" corkscrew). Pushing down on the levers
                    brings the worm out of the bottle, with the cork attached, and the bottle is now open. I wanted to apply this same idea, but instead of having a device drive down into the lid, it would 
                    clamp to the lid's sides and rotate upwards while the levers were pushed back down. To the left are photos highlighting the intended use of a winged corkscrew and my drawings on how I would 
                    modify this design for a jar lid.

            To properly clamp to the side of the lid, I would have a pre-set size for the clamps that would fit the most common jar size. To rotate, while the gears in the levers are being turned as someone pushes down
            on them, there would be a threaded channel that would allow the clamps to move within a confined space but not fall out of the apparatus. With this modified idea in mind, I now had to test to see if a corkscrew 
            model would actually print properly on the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer.<br><br>

            Using a pre-existing online model, I sent my winged corkscrew to the 3D printers in two different orientations. To minimize the amount of supports in an attempt to preserve the integrity of the print, I tried
            printing the corkscrew while it was perpendicular to the heat bed. The other print was executed while the corkscrew was parallel to the heat bed. However, this orientation difference greatly affected the integrity of 
            the prints.

                Both corkscrews utilized the Prusa Slicer Software's organic supports. Rather than having rigid material, similar to scaffolding, that would tarnish the print and would be difficult to get off, the organic supports 
                provide a good base for the model to be built while having few connecting points on the model itself. This allows for structural integrity while not ruining the print.<br><br>
                I tested how well the supports would hold when printing 
                the vertical corkscrew and as shown on the left, not very well. Printing on an unstable plane was difficult for the Prusa Mini+ as parts of the model were underextruded and there was heavy stringing between any two points on the print. 
                The filament also wasn't able to lay flat enough, resulting in unstable layers that may have caused breakage during the print, specifically on the stem part of the worm driver. The infill was seen at the very top and 
                interestingly, the base of the main organic support was slightly brown compared to the rest of the print. I suspect it sat on the hot plate for too long or the nozzle was too hot in the beginning, causing the filament to melt and burn 
                a bit, leading to discoloration.<br><br> 
                
                The print on the right came out with even layers and much less stringing since all parts were properly supported. Although the same settings were used for these organic supports, changing the model orientation affected where 
                the supports were placed and how beneficial they would be as the print was being made. Although difficult to notice, the gears and overall "functional" parts of the screw were still not as durable or as useful as I had hoped. With slight 
                pressure, the levers would begin to bend and the worm driver was barely able to screw downwards. A lot of these complications are due to physical limitations and the durability of the model itself.<br><br> 

                For physical limitations, models I hope to print can only be as large as the build plate is. This means if I were to remix the winged corkscrew model to be functional with an average sized jar, the corkscrew would have to be much bigger than
                the actual build plate. As for model technicalities, I believe I need to do further research on how I would mechanically change where the forces are being applied and gain enough strength and rotational motion to twist off a jar lid.<br><br> 

                This model was made to test the functional integrity of a 3D print to help those with arthritis in their hands; in short, it was a model made for hands. This made me of think of pursuing further tests using hand models!

            Hand Model Printing Tests

                    I wanted to explore two key aspects from the previous corkscrew attempt: how variations in the model's structure affect its strength as well as exploring the capabilites of organic supports. Keeping the hand theme design, I used a pre-existing hook 
                    design meant to attach to a wall and support any object that could fit on the hand. To quickly test structural design changes, I attempted to print only the object's infill without the model walls surrounding it
                    so the weight of an object would be held up only by the infill designs and not from the design of the model itself. For this, the honeycomb infill was best since it's natural structure allows for 
                    structural support in 3 directions and mechanical resistance for the entire print.<br><br> 

                    To ensure durability, I set the <b>infill to 60%</b>. As there were was some overhang, I also included organic supports to support the back and front parts of the hand. With the all-infill structure and support material, 
                    my print took about 6.5 hours with the infill using majority of the model's total filament - 40.78 grams. As seen on the heat plate, the dense infill made the print look underextruded if it was printing under normal conditions. This model 
                    was also quite heavy compared to the winged corkscrew or previous prints made with the same printer, despite this print only using infill. This means even if the model doesn't have defined walls for a smooth exterior, model weight closely correlates to the 
                    amount of filament used, with more filament also equating to an increased print time.

                   The first hand hook iteration was too dense, used too much filament, and had a long printing time. In the next two iterations, I printed a hook with only 20% infill, still with no wall exterior covering it, and a "control" hand to compare 
                   the quality of my infill test prints to how I would usually print this design. All hands were sliced in the same orientation and used the same organic support placed in the similar locations throughout the model.<br><br>
    
                   For the model printed with <b>20% infill</b> and included supports, the printing time decreased to 3 hours while the majority of PLA filament used on the infill decreasing from 40.78 grams to 16.58 grams. Even before seeing the finished product,
                   I knew this model would be lighter than the previous iteration. In the completed print, there was noticeable stringing between the fingers compared to the first hand hook iteration. PLA filament is usually extruded at a temperature of 210 degrees Celsius, but
                   because I was using a different printer containing a different PLA type, I increased the nozzle temperature to 215 degrees Celsius due to past troubleshooting tips regarding this specific type of filament. To reduce this stringing in the future, I may modify the
                   temperatures more as well as adjust the movement speed of the printer since the stringing as consistent throughout all of the infill holes.<br><br>
    
                   For the <b>default model</b>, everything was printed with standard Prusa Slicer settings. The same honeycomb infill, which was used in the other two hand hooks, was set to 15% and the organic supports also remained at the same locations. Since I was printing exterior walls 
                   to the infill, the total amount used for both the infill and surrounding walls was 19.73 grams and the print time was 3.5 hours. Some stringing did occur on this print but overall, the design was clean, smooth, and lightweight.

                   While printing the model, it seems like the structure held up well and the supports kept everything in place with no print failures. However, the real challenge was testing how much weight and for how long these hand hooks could hold. 
                   Although I couldn't attach these hooks into a wall, I had a secure grip on the hook's base as I used each hand to pick up various objects or have objects hanging from them. All hooks comfortably held up a keyring, scissors, and a cup. The most challenging stress test was my backpack, 
                   weighing at most 30 pounds when completely packed. I picked up my backpack, holding the hooks with a similar grip and orientation, 3 times for each print. As shown below, the red hand hook broke as the the material wasn't durable enough to withstand the high weight. The other two
                   remained intact, with minimal layer separation if at all. In this round of test prints, the red hand hook was the lightest but also the weakest. Strength correlates to weight, but in future tests, I would like to take advantage of different infill designs or perhaps 
                   create a new model lightweight designed to withstand stressful conditions.

                    From all of my previous prints, now it was time to remix models! Using TinkerCAD, I aimed to take two, pre-exisisting models and combine them together to form something new.
                    Once again, keeping in line with my hand theme, I wanted to make a jewelry stand with a hand as the centerpiece. I thought about printing only the infill this time, but in this case, 
                    weight and durability weren't so critical to the final product compared to the aesthetics and functionality the model could provide; thus, I opted for the traditional printing style. Looking at existing products online, I didn't like how bare and unstable 
                    the stands looked; adding a base would not only provide support but it would also double the model's versatility as people could store bracelets, small jewelry, or necklaces without 
                    risk of the accessories falling off the stand.<br><br> 
                    
                    As shown in my drawing, I initially thought about a hand holding a bowl in order to incorporate other types of 
                    accessory storage beyond rings. However, even before printing, the hand's base still seemed bare despite the extra stability it provided. Plus, by putting a bowl at the top of the hand, the finger storage functionality would be lost 
                    and most of the jewelry would be stored in disarray. I then thought to use the bowl design as the base, but the scooped design of any basic bowl would it difficult to see what was actually 
                    being stored. Thus, my final design iteration resulted in me combining a crown and an outstretched hand to form my completed jewelry stand design.

                    Although a shallow dish would have had low walls, provided a wide base for the hand to rest on, and would accomodate other bracelets or longer jewelry, I opted for the crown design 
                    instead since the diamond holes could be used to store jewelry with hooks, such as earrings. I wanted to maximize style with functionality, and every part of this remixed model can be used 
                    in a constructive way. As for the final print qualities, stringing was a slight problem between all of the fingers but was cleanly and easily cleared away. The organic supports also left minimal scarring 
                    and easily popped off of the hand.<br><br> 
                    
                    For any future iterations of this remixed design, I would adjust the finger locations so the hand isn't so spread out and it's easier 
                    to slip hair ties or braclets over the top. I would also experiment with different crown designs, opting for rounder edges compared to the pointed tips.
                    Regardless, I and my roommate think the jewelry stand is a success!
