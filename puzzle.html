            Needs Statement

        <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px;">
            It was important that we had identified a client willing to work with us, but we now needed to conceptualize and further condense our idea into a tangible and useful project for them. One good way to express our intentions that would also help guide 
            us in the iterative process is through a Needs Statement. Our general intention is to create an educational, entertaning, and inclusive tactile puzzle for visually impaired and seeing children to enjoy together. After talking with our client at the Carroll Center, we 
            decided to approach this problem by creating a project that would help improve visually impaired childrens' spatial awareneess, specifically in the context of roads.

            Ideally, we wanted to work with a specific child in order to create a highly specialized puzzle for them that would help with a specific problem related to them being visually impaired. We were looking for a child anywhere from the age of 
            6 to 10 years old as a child would still be adapting to their newfound life, regardless if they were born blind or became blind at a later date. Since children, especially those that are visually impaired, take in majority of the world throgh touch, 
            we wanted a puzzle that would not only be fun to play with and feel, but could also make a positive impact on their daily life. We wanted to create a product that could combine educational and recreational use in order to keep the child engaged as they learn something new.   
            One method of communication mainly visually-impaired people use is Braille, an alphabet consisting of raised dots on a page that can be used to spell out words and make sentences. However, a child may struggle associating a word in Braille to what the word actually represents. 
            For example, they may read the word "fish" but may have no sense of what a fish looks like, its general shape, or any identifying characteristics that makes this animal different from another animal. With this in mind, we began searching for potential prototypes that we could present 
            to potential clients during our first informational meeting.

            Our team quickly and effectively delegated roles so we could maximize our efficiency with the limited time we had. Suho began searching for potential prototypes that could be printed quickly while Areen and I drafted up an email template 
            to send to three different organizations: Perkins School for the Blind, Lowell Association for the Blind (LAB), and The Carroll Center for the Blind. With great success, two out of three organizations responded to our inquiry and we were able to schedule 
            meetings with both the Carroll Center and the Perkins School! I have had personal organization and event planning experience, so cold-emailing people wasn't something new to me. However, it was still important to draft a professional and clear template 
            that demonstrated our intentions for working with these organizations. As shown below, and with some proofreading from ChatGPT, we had a concise email briefly introducing the team, our project goals, and inquiring for any future follow-ups if this is an initiative 
            the organization would be interested in.<br><br>

            <b>Dear [Organization Name],<br><br> 
                We are a team of undergraduates at Brandeis University interested in collaborating with [organization name] on developing a tactile puzzle designed for educational and entertainment purposes. 
                Our goal is to create an inclusive and engaging learning experience that caters to the unique needs of visually impaired students in your program. If you are interested, our team would love to talk with 
                a faculty member an any educators so we can better understand the program curriculum and how students interact with the space, either for learning or for recreational use. <br><br>If anyone is available for a Zoom meeting, please let us
                know your availability this coming week and we will make necessary arrangements. Thank you for considering our request, and we hope to connect with you soon!</b><br><br> 

                With this email sent out, we continued our prototype preparation. Sticking with our initial idea of incorporating Braille into our interactive puzzle, we printed a sample puzzle of a fish. As pictured, the puzzle consists of four 
                letters, with each piece having a corresponding letter on it in Braille that would have to be placed in the correct order in order for the puzzle shape and word to make sense. This was our main open-source prototype combining educational 
                and recreational uses, but we prepared some extra ideas as well. Focusing more on entertainment and encouraging the use of touch to solve problems, we thought of a laser cut puzzle box that would require the user to solve certain parts on 
                any side of the cube in order to progress and reach the end goal. This wouldn't incorporate Braille, but would rather be a fun way for the user to grow acustomed to solving something without seeing it. Thinking again from an educational perspective, 
                we also thought of a Braille puzzle, in which there would be tiles with the letters of the alphabet on them and the user would have to stack the tiles in the correct order in order for the box to be whole again. This idea would be focused towards children 
                newly introduced to Braille and need a way to reinforce the letter-to-bump correspondence.

            All of this development was great, but we were still trying to solve a problem for a visually impaired child/person without any of us having any vision problems ourselves. We were definitely doing our best to think 
            empathetically, but it was evident to the entire team that our meeting with the Carroll Center would allow us to gain a new perspective and ideas for us to work on. In preparation for our meeting, we prepared some 
            key questions that would help us better understand what problems actually need to be solved and how a tactile puzzle could accomplish that. We also wanted to learn more about any daily tasks, either accomodations or
            current struggles, that any visually impaired person or child may face. It's important for us to design with intent, and we wanted to solidfy our project intention and stance before progressing forward with a client.<br><br>

            <ul class="col-lg 6" style="text-align:center; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px">
                <b>1. What are some successes or challenges you (the faculty/educator) or the children face while trying to learn Braille?</b><br>
                <b>2. What services are currently provided to children? How are the Braille events taught at the Carroll Center?</b><br>
                <b>3. What level of challenge would the children prefer when solving the puzzle? Should we develop more for entertainment or for education?</b><br>
                <b>4. Could you share any input from visually impaired children or parents regarding their preferences or needs for educational materials?</b>

        <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px">
            We were now ready to meet with our potential client! We talked with the Accessibility Training and Research Coordinator at the Carroll Center, who was accompanied by two members that were also visually impaired. One had 
            been blind for majority of his life while the other developed blindness later on, causing a need for adjustment between two ways of living. We presented who we were and our desire to develop a useful product applicable for 
            education and recreational use, specifically focusing on incorporating Braille into our puzzle. While our attendees were in agreement, they also presented a new problem none of us had considered: spatial reasoning. They mentioned 
            how blind children are more sheltered around others since they are naturally cautious of the world around them. This is due to a lack of spatial awareness regarding their surroundings; it's harder for them to fully visualize the space 
            they're in or some of the objects they may hold. A great example the attendees mentioned was a blind child interacting with a car. To anyone with sight, we know that a car has 4 wheels and 4 doors, with different seats, windows, and a steering 
            wheel. However, the child may think of the car as just a seat and door handle that magically moves and changes direction since those are the only the parts of the car they typically touch. It became increasingly clear to our team that there 
            needed to be a better way for children to visualize the full composition of an object. Some other aspects that were brought up in the meeting, also focused on spatial reasoning, were that many blind children are afraid of animals, stemming from the 
            fact that they don't understand how the animal acts or what it looks like. Those that are visually impaired would also struggle to navigate a website since they don't have "digital spatial awareness" about where components of a webpage are. This 
            would include aspects like the toolbar, the exit button, where links and articles are on a page, etc.<br><br> 

            Another clear design choice the attendees mentioned was that this puzzle, although being developed for a good cause, should be inclusive rather than exclusive. The puzzle should be an activity that both blind and sighted children can enjoy 
            so they can learn from one another and interact in spite of their different life experiences. I thought this point was really interesting as this input would challenge us to develop something that should be accessible to those that are visually-impaired, but 
            is also fully accessible to those that can see the pieces.<br><br> 

            We agreed to reach out again with any project follow-ups or possible solutions we developed and ended our first client meeting. Overall, I thought this meeting was extremely beneficial as it provided us with new perspectives and possible design 
            choices we hadn't previously considered in spite of developing a product with empathy in mind. Nothing is as beneficial as getting feedback from someone that knows firsthand what does and doesn't work in their lifestyle and what tools can be developed 
            to lessen any general burdens they may face.

            We are yet to meet any representatives from the Perkins School for the Blind but we continued with our design process with the newfound perspectives we gained from our initial meeting with the Carroll Center. 
            Utilizing IBM design techniques, we decided to do an empathy map and a prioritization grid in order to better understand our users' perception of the world as well as how our product may actually be useful to the client in 
            comparison to our current design skillsets. This ensures we are developing a puzzle with a realistic goal that will have a positive impact on the user.

            In the empathy map, some key aspects we focused on is that visually-impaired people use their hands to see the world, they may want a sense of independence rather than feeling limited and frustrated by their limited perception 
            of the world around them, the puzzle should be inclusive for all age groups, and should foster practical imagination in which the user can grasp a better visualization of what they're touching. In the prioritization grid, we began comparing 
            our project ideas against our feasibility for implementation and the product value to the user. In the "un-wise" category, we had ideas such as a braille-based card game, ideas incorporating sound and electronics, and objects that would help blind children 
            better understand daily tasks (such as cooking). Although some were more feasible than others, we opted to not pursue them since we were unsure how impactful this would be to the user and what further changes we could impleent in comparison 
            to things that already exist. In our next category, a lot of our ideas were focused on entertainment rather than education as we discussed developing a chess game, a Braille0based Scrabble game, and a puzzle box based on texture rather than visual interlocking parts. 
            We thought these ideas promoted the inclusive nature of our product as both visual and non-visual users could enjoy it together. However, what would make the product perfect is if we could incorporate more of an education component into our design. This led to our 
            last group of ideas, including things such as special keyboards containing both Braille and traditional letters, a farm puzzle in which users would have to match the texture and name of the animal with the correct corresponding animal pen, and variations of street-based 
            maps that would allow those that are visually-impaired to better understand how an intersection works so it isn't as daunting to cross them.<br><br> 

            With all of these ideas, we were able to list and rank our top 5 choices for implementation:
            <ul class="col-lg 6" style="text-align:left; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px">
                <b>1. Road Map - most versatile and beneficial for the client, but also challenges our current CAD/CAM skills </b><br>
                <b>2. Farm Matching - would help the user better understand animals, but textures would be difficult to implement</b><br>
                <b>3. Maze - both sighted and non-sighted users could use this puzzle, but it wasn't as practical or beneficial for improving spatial awareness in the real world</b><br>
                <b>4. Chess Game - variations of textured boards already exist on the market and this tool wouldn't be as beneifical for improving spatial reasoning. </b>
                <b>4. State Map - felt like too large of an approach of the road map idea and frankly, wasn't as exciting of an idea to any of the team members</b>

            My team and I are now ready to begin the heart of our project: developing a tactile puzzle depciting a real-world intersection that will help visually-impaired users better understand
