            Needs Statement & Key Goals
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px;">
            It was important that we had identified a client willing to work with us, but we now needed to conceptualize and further condense our idea into a tangible and useful project for them. One good way to express our intentions that would also help guide 
            us in the iterative process is through a Needs Statement. Our general intention is to create an educational, entertaning, and inclusive tactile puzzle for visually impaired and seeing children to enjoy together. After talking with our client at the Carroll Center, we 
            decided to approach this problem by creating a project that would help improve visually impaired childrens' spatial awareneess, specifically in the context of roads. This addresses the idea of "what our user really needs" from two different angles. The first angle is that 
            the blind child is able to obtain a greater understanding of the world around them in a fun and interactive way. The second angle is encouraging communication and engagement between sighted and non-sighted children to break down any stigmas between the two groups and foster 
            meaningful interactions.<br><br> 

            With these persepctives in mind, we began brainstorming some useful puzzle features that could provide an inclusive experience to anyone using it. To make the puzzle as realistic as possible, we initially wanted to model puzzle pieces from real-world maps of streets 
            in the Boston area. There were multiple online sources containing various 3D models and images of organized segments throughout the area, but we realized that it would be too time consuming - and perhaps too challenging for our user - to utilize a fragment of a pre-existing segmnent 
            of the greater Boston area. Taking a less complicated approach, we then thought about creating an idealized road map that anyone could follow. It wouldn't be of a specific place, but it would include crucial elements that could help a child understand how roads work and where they can safely 
            cross without getting hurt. This would include things like crosswalks, 3-way intersections, 4-way intersections, straight and curved roads, and possible bridges. Thanks to a pre-existing set of road tile pieces, this was the basis for the majority of our puzzle pieces that we hoped to include 
            in the tactile puzzle. However, one obstacle that was prevalent both in our brainstorming sessiosns and throughout our iterations was how the user would be able to match the correct tile piece with the correct spot on the board as well as how the tile pieces would stay in place when put together.<br><br> 

            As pictured in our brainstorming sessions below, we thought about using corresponding texture between the tile pieces and the board itself. Taking note of how a road tile piece looks, there is plenty of room for smooth sidewalks, a rough road, and slightly raised divider lines separating the two halves 
            of the road. Although 3D printing allows for the fast iteration we require for this project, there is nothing discerning the texture of the road from the sidewalk except for a slight indent on the tile piece. Our initial idea was to include a rough texture, something similar to asphalt or like the material 
            found on skateboards since that would be possible to laser cut, and attaching that both the tile piece and the corresponding part on the board. This way, the user is not only matching the direction the road is going but also the differing texture of the road, discerning the different between a sidewalk versus 
            a crosswalk. This texture feature is something we hope to implement in the future, but as for now, it was more crucial that we gained a clearer understanding of how a user will interact with the puzzle and how the pieces will connect together.<br><br>

            The Iterative Process 
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px;">
            We approached two possible puzzle designs in our first approach: one with the individual road tile pieces representing different parts of the road that would be pieced together and another where we would insert large chunks of the road onto pre-existing road dividers. The latter method, 
            with a sample shown below, didn't seem as exciting for the user to assemble as large chunks of the road could be completed in only one to two moves. There was also fitting complications that would make it difficult to perfectly match up all road pieces with the cutout divider slots since there 
            is some variable tolerance we need to account for when 3D printing. The tile pieces were much more promising and interactive for the user. However, based on our test tiles that were printed, we concluded that doing anything complicated with bridges, ramps, and highway overpasses would stray from our intention 
            of the puzzle as it may be too complex and unnecessary for the user to currently understand; it's uncommon that they would have to figure out how to walk up and across a highway compared to a traditional crosswalk found at an intersection. From a feasible, production standpoint, it was also difficult 
            to print ample support for the bridges and highway overpasses on the 3D printer due to how the model is configured and where the supports could be placed. Thus, the individual tiles would become our puzzle pieces. Our first board iteration did include alternatives to these tile pieces, in which the pieces would click 
            into place within an engraved slot on the board that corresponded with the road pieces. Rather than having tiles slide on a flat surface, the board would be indented with the road design that the user would have to match up. Pictured below is a sample section of what the entire board could look like, but we realized 
            that there were also fitting complications between the road pieces and the board as the pieces wouldn't all smoothly insert into the slots. We also didn't have ample space for crosswalks on each tile piece, something that a visually-impaired user would find helpful when understanding road layouts since that's something 
            they would most likely interact with. For further design iterations, we wanted to include buildings and other decor, such as lamps and stoplights, to add some fun and an extra layer of challenge to the puzzle. To allow for customization and creativity, we modeled the rest of the board with a "lego-approach", creating pegs 
            on all other surfaces so users could place decorative pieces wherever they chose. However, this was another case of "good idea, but poor execution" as the pegs were quite rough and varied in size, making it difficult for users to properly insert pieces onto a selection of pegs. There was also the problem of stringing between the
            pegs, adding an additional layer of complication. From this, we knew that we were utilizing the smoother tile pieces on a flat board rather than dealing with complicated and clunky pieces that would slot in to engraved parts of the board.

           <br>Now, the team had the challenge of iterating how the puzzle pieces would fit together and what roadmap could be portrayed. Since the tile pieces we were planning to use consisted of straight roads, curved roads, three-way intersections, and four-way intersections, we challeneged ourselves to design an accessible but 
           complex map that would be fun for users to put together. Through much iteration and thinking about how the roads match up with one another, we opted to create a large roundabout consisting of intersection and curved road pieces that connected to the rest of the board filled with four-way intersections, turns, and
           lengths of straight road. Once again, modeling our puzzle from a pre-exisitng layout may have been too confusing for the user, but the team felt that this would provide ample enough challenge while still helping visually-impaired users improve their understanding and spatial awareness of a street layout. After some quick math 
           and sizing expectations, our board was going to be 5 tiles by 5 tiles, resulting in 25 total pieces for users to match to the correct spot on the board. Since we were still testing ideas, we focused on how users could match up the tiles to the board rather than how the tiles could stay in place once the user thinks 
           they correctly put the piece to the corresponding position. We deemed it more important to grasp the core intention of our puzzle, which is board to piece correspondence, before handling tile positioning. Improving upon our original board idea, with an indented road to help users correctly match pieces, we made the indent much 
           more shallow to the point that the user could tell what the road looked like but could simply place a road piece on top of the indented guidelines on the board. Thus, when the puzzle is complete, all tile pieces would be flush with the frame of the board and there would be a smooth, even surface depicting the various turns and 
           intersections in the road. 
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px;">
            Our overall decor pieces, to be specific, consisted of 7 lamps, 2 stoplights, a tree with a planting box, a police station, a restaurant, a school, and 3 sets of houses that would typically line a street. This was our attempt at adding some realism to the puzzle while also having the user exercise creative freedom since majority 
            of the decor pieces could be placed anywhere. The lamps were attached to circular pegs on the straight road tile pieces while the stoplights would attach to the four-way intersection pieces. There were some complications printing out these specific parts due to how fine the material was and the layer height as the structure was being built. 
            This problem was especially prevalent in the streetlights due to their overhanging nature over the street pieces. Overall, our pieces came out looking complete and well!

            Feedback & Next Steps
        </h2>

        <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px">
            Although we do have a functional product that highlights our product intentions, we are still looking for user and client-specific feedback that can help us perfect our tactile puzzle. Although we weren't able to bring our product to the client directly, we tested the puzzle ourselves to better understand how visually-impaired users 
            may use our product. Although no one on the team was blind, we closed our eyes and attempted to assemble the puzzle as intended. One thing we noticed that we need to revise in future iterations is that it was difficult to discern between the texture of the crosswalk to a normal road division on the board. This is likely due to how the raised elements 
            were printed, resulting in the crosswalk bars being too close together rather than separated with a different texture. Although we were the ones that created this puzzle, it was still a doable challenge for us to assemble the puzzle with our eyes closed for the first time. However, we agreed that once you assembled it a few times, the user could remember 
            where the pieces go rather than improve upon their spatial awareness and understanding. When Professor Roy also attempted the puzzle, someone that had no prior knowledge of the road setup, he listed the same problems we noted. He mentioned some struggles specifically with the tile pieces in which our tactic for matching the piece with the section 
            of the board was good, but there needed to be a better way to keep the tiles in place once the user settled on where it should go. There was also a road width discrepancy between the guide on the board and what was printed on the tiles, so a slight adjustmnet also had to be made there as well. Professor Roy also noted 
            the lack of replayability over a certain period of time; to combat this, he suggested we make the bottom of the board a puzzle in itself. Road pieces would correspond to traditional puzzle pieces, with the negative and positive connections directing the flow of the road. 
            This way, the puzzle changes multiple times and provides the user with a fresh perspective each time. He alluded that this could lead into the gamification of our product, an interesting angle that the team may pursue further with Brandeis's SPARK Program that can help students market their product and gain entrepreneurship experience.<br><br>

            From this mock user feedback, our next steps involve working on small, but critical details in our tactile puzzle. Using Neodymium magnet bars that can be inserted into the road tile pieces, we can connect the guided portions of the board with the tile pieces that the user can put on, allowing the puzzle pieces to be removable but still secure in the frame. 
            We are also reprinting and modifying our designs for the lamps and streetlights in order to produce a more secure product. Overall, these iterations have been a success and we are working towards a clear goal as we modfy these last details in our tactile puzzle.
